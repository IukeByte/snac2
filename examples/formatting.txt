Messages in `snac` allow a special subset of Markdown, that includes *emphasized*, **strong** and `monospaced` styles by surrounding text with one asterisk, two asterisks or backquotes, respectively.

Line breaks are output as you write it.


Prepending a greater-than symbol in a line makes it a quote:

> This is quoted text
>
> All angle-prepended lines are grouped in the same blockquote

It also allows preformatted text using three backquotes in a single line:

```
  /* this is preformatted text */

  struct node {
      struct node *prev;
      struct node *next;
  };

```
